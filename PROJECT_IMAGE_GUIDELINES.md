## ✅ FLEXIBLE IMAGE DISPLAY

**The website now displays images flexibly - any size will work!**

### **Recommended Size (Optional):**
- **Dimensions**: **1600px × 900px** (or any size you prefer)
- **Aspect Ratio**: **Any ratio works** (landscape recommended)
- **Format**: JPG (recommended) or WebP
- **Max File Size**: 600-800KB (after compression)
- **Orientation**: Landscape (horizontal) works best

## Image Requirements:

1. **Aspect Ratio**: Must be **16:9** (width:height)
   - Example: 1600px wide × 900px tall
   - The website uses `aspect-video` which requires this ratio

2. **File Format**: 
   - **JPG** (best for photos) - recommended
   - **WebP** (better compression, smaller file size)
   - **PNG** (only if you need transparency)

3. **Compression**:
   - Compress images before uploading
   - Use tools like TinyPNG, Squoosh, or ImageOptim
   - Aim for 70-85% quality for JPG
   - Target file size: 600-800KB

4. **Content Placement**:
   - Images display fully without cropping
   - No need to worry about edge cropping
   - Your entire image will be visible

## Quick Setup:

1. **Resize your image** to exactly **1600px × 900px**
2. **Compress** it to reduce file size (600-800KB)
3. **Save as JPG** (or WebP)
4. **Upload** through the admin panel

That's it! This one size will work perfectly on:
- ✅ Mobile phones (all sizes)
- ✅ Tablets (all sizes)  
- ✅ Desktop computers (all sizes)
- ✅ All pages (listing, detail, admin)

## Current Upload Limits:

- **Max file size**: 5MB per image (but aim for 600-800KB)
- **Supported formats**: JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF
- **Multiple images**: You can upload multiple images per project
